# nvim
This project is still under construction!!

My version of Neovim. After countless hours of searching the web for
answers on how to configure lsp, linting, formatters and others, I have
made this setup so others can reuse.
I will soon be adding more detailed readme and more customizable structure 
to this neovim.
